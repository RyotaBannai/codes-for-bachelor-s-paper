# Codes for my Bachelor's paper in 2015
This repository includes:
・Neural Network algorithm that evaluates which indredients would go well together for cuisine recipes.
・Genetic Algorithm that simply generates new multiple cuisine recipes and leaves some of the best recipes.

#Setup
1. This NN althorism uses Supervised learning, requiring pairs consisting of an input data and a desired output value (aka the supervisory signal)
2. After NN learning, GA takes part into generating new cuisine recipe and leaveing highly rated recipes with NN.
